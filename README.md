# CoffeeTimeAdventures
Unreal Engine Game - Coffee Time Adventures

Explore the 5 Worlds. Coffee Time Adventures takes place across five major worlds and various minor locations:
☕ Coffee World: Home of Cup Joe, Thermos, and Little Miss Hot Shot. Coffee World is a peaceful land where it’s always Coffee Time, and Joe’s Coffee Shop is the favorite local hangout.
🍩 Donut World: Home of Donette. Donut World is a delicious and magical place with rivers of chocolate, mountaintops of pink frosting, and seas of sprinkles stretching out into the horizon.
🌀 Warp World: This harmonic world provides a wide variety of beats, sounds, rhythms, and tempos to all of the creatures of all of the Worlds. Warp World also serves as a boundary between the worlds that prefer coffee and those that prefer tea. Utterly mysterious, this world may harbor secrets yet to be revealed.
🏰 Crumpet World: Sound the trumpets! Here come the crumpets, marching to the beat of King Tea’s war drums. These simple creatures are generally harmless and well-meaning; however, riled-up and gathered in frighteningly large numbers, they have become King Tea’s mindless minions of mayhem.
🍵 Tea World: Home of King Tea and the Duchess. Tea World is a fragile and elegant kingdom. Visitors love the constant parades, celebrations, feasts, and tea time at the royal moon garden. However, the locals are prideful, and it is easy for them to get a chip on their shoulders about real or perceived attacks on their reputations. They have not taken kindly to Coffee World’s growing popularity, which has cast a shadow over Tea World’s extravagance.
⚰️ Crumpet Cemetery: Explore Romer's mosoleum, visit graves, dodge crumpet security, enjoy orange juice fountains, a natural pool, and visit the syrup shack.
🚀 Deep Space Station: A floating outpost connecting all worlds through interdimensional travel.
